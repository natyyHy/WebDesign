                   JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                   It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                   (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                   objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                   them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
                        form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant
                        to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an
                        application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from
                        one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mobile JavaScript extends the language to interact with mobile devices, enabling access to
                        features like GPS, accelerometer, and camera. Frameworks like React Native allow developers
                        to build mobile apps using JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Game Development JavaScript extends the language for creating interactive games. Libraries such
                        as Phaser.js and Three.js provide tools for rendering graphics, handling physics, and managing 
                        animations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Machine Learning JavaScript extends the language to support artificial intelligence applications. 
                        Libraries like TensorFlow.js enable developers to build and train machine learning models directly
                        in the browser or on a server.

            <article>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");</code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript
                is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some 
                examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
                <code>x = 42.</code>
                <code>let y = 13.</code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Escopo_de_variáveis" >
            <header>Escopo de variáveis</header>
            <article>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you 
                declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) 
                that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared,
                not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
